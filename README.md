#ES6-Workshop

##Welcome
Welcome to this ES6 workshop. Our goal is to help everyone makes strides towards learning the newest ES6 syntax, and
how to use the latest constructs in JavaScript.

This repo is meant to be used in parallel with a lecture style presentation of the new features.

##Your Goals
This repo is full of failing tests. The only way to get them to pass it by using your newly acquired knowledge of ES6
and all of the new features that are part of this latest release. For each test, you will need to write/rewrite to code
using the latest ES6 syntax. Once all of your tests pass, you will want to move onto the next section.

By the time that the workshop is over, all of your tests will be passing.

##How To Get Started

###Clone the repo
You will need to start by cloning this repo. From your terminal, type:
```
git clone git@github.com:aaronfrost/es6-workshop.git && cd es6-workshop
```

###Install Dependencies
Once you have cloned the repo, in need to install the local dependencies. From your terminal, type:
```
npm install --global babel && npm install
```

*Note that this step will install `Babel` globally. This project uses Babel to provide support for ES6 syntax. Without
it, we wouldn't be able to use many of these features.*
